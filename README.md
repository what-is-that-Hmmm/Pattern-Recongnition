Auxiliary files:	sample_PVT.m 		(This function is for taking the target values of pressure, vibrationsand temperatures )
			sample_Electrodes.m 	(This function is for taking the target values of electrodes)
			plotting_PVTE.m		(This function plots the pressure, vibration, temperature, and Electrodes)
			plot_MS_3PCs.m		(For plotting the most 3 significant PCs)
			PCA_PVT.m		(This function is for conducting PCA on a 3D dataset. Particularly for PVT)
